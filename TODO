implement small gui app on top, to exercise library and to discover
what features should be added to rubyzip next.

implement setting the date correctly in ZipEntry with now as default

Refactor ZipFileTest to reduce duplicated code, divide into different
test classes if different fixtures are required and use setup/teardown
some more. Clean up AssertEntry module.
