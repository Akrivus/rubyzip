Glob.expandPath(List) needs to be changed to work with non-string
objects. To stay untied to ZipEntry, it will need to be configured
with an abstract factory for creating entries from strings. It may be
necessary to change Glob.glob to not call expandPathList because it
will be unnatural to have to pass down an entry factory. Tests will
have to be refactored.

FileArchive needs to be completed.


unit test and implement:
* globbing (Glob module implemented and unit tested, but not used)
* adding directories recursively
* recursive extract
* recursive extract with block for determining whether directories should be created.
* ZipFile.checkIntegrity method
* non-MSDOS permission attributes
** See mail from Ned Konz to ruby-talk subj. "Re: SV: [ANN] Archive 0.2"
* Packager version, required unpacker version in zip headers
** See mail from Ned Konz to ruby-talk subj. "Re: SV: [ANN] Archive 0.2"
* Write interface adapters or adapt interface of rubyzip to become compatible with the "Archive module", which supports ar, tar and mbox

implement small gui app on top, to exercise library and to discover
what features should be added to rubyzip next.

implement storing attributes and ownership information

make release

Refactor ZipFileTest to reduce duplicated code, divide into different
test classes if different fixtures are required and use setup/teardown
some more. Clean up AssertEntry module.
