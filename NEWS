= Version 0.4.0 =

ZipFile is now mutable and provides a more convenient way of modifying
zip archives than ZipOutputStream.

Runs without warnings with -w switch.

= Version 0.3.1 =

Rudimentary support for writing zip archives.

= Version 0.2.2 =

Fixed and extended unit test suite. Updated to work with ruby/zlib
0.5. It doesn't work with earlier versions of ruby/zlib.

= Version 0.2.0 =

Class ZipFile added. Where ZipInputStream is used to read the
individual entries in a zip file, ZipFile reads the central directory
in the zip archive, so you can get to any entry in the zip archive
without having to skipping through all the preceeding entries.

= Version 0.1.0 =

First working version of ZipInputStream.
