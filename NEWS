= Version 0.5.0 =

Added ZipFile.directory and ZipFile.file - each method return an
object that can be used like Dir and File only for the contents of the
zip file. Added FileArchive module which ZipFile mix in. FileArchive
provides filename globbing, regex selection, recursive
extraction/addition, and other convenience methods. Now works with
ruby 1.7.2. Added sample application zipfind which works like
Find.find, only Zip::ZipFind.find traverses into zip archives too.

Bug fixes:
* AbstractInputStream.each_line with different separator


= Version 0.5.0a =

Source reorganized. Added ziprequire, which can be used to load ruby
modules from a zip file, in a fashion similar to jar files in
Java. Added gtkRubyzip, another sample application. Implemented
ZipInputStream.lineno and ZipInputStream.rewind

Bug fixes: 

* Read and write date and time information correctly for zip entries. 
* Fixed read() using separate buffer, causing mix of gets/readline/read to
cause problems. 

= Version 0.4.2 =

Performance optimizations. Test suite runs in half the time.

= Version 0.4.1 =

Windows compatibility fixes.

= Version 0.4.0 =

Zip::ZipFile is now mutable and provides a more convenient way of
modifying zip archives than Zip::ZipOutputStream. Operations for
adding, extracting, renaming, replacing and removing entries to zip
archives are now available.

Runs without warnings with -w switch.

Install script install.rb added.


= Version 0.3.1 =

Rudimentary support for writing zip archives.


= Version 0.2.2 =

Fixed and extended unit test suite. Updated to work with ruby/zlib
0.5. It doesn't work with earlier versions of ruby/zlib.


= Version 0.2.0 =

Class ZipFile added. Where ZipInputStream is used to read the
individual entries in a zip file, ZipFile reads the central directory
in the zip archive, so you can get to any entry in the zip archive
without having to skipping through all the preceeding entries.


= Version 0.1.0 =

First working version of ZipInputStream.
