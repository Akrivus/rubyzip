= Version 0.4.3 =

Source reorganized. Added ziprequire, which can be used to load ruby
modules from a zip file, in a fashion similar to jar files in
Java. Added gtkRubyzip, another sample application. Added support for
filename globbing with ? and *. Reads and writes date and time
information correctly for zip entries.

= Version 0.4.2 =

Performance optimizations. Test suite runs in half the time.

= Version 0.4.1 =

Windows compatibility fixes.

= Version 0.4.0 =

Zip::ZipFile is now mutable and provides a more convenient way of
modifying zip archives than Zip::ZipOutputStream. Operations for
adding, extracting, renaming, replacing and removing entries to zip
archives are now available.

Runs without warnings with -w switch.

Install script install.rb added.


= Version 0.3.1 =

Rudimentary support for writing zip archives.


= Version 0.2.2 =

Fixed and extended unit test suite. Updated to work with ruby/zlib
0.5. It doesn't work with earlier versions of ruby/zlib.


= Version 0.2.0 =

Class ZipFile added. Where ZipInputStream is used to read the
individual entries in a zip file, ZipFile reads the central directory
in the zip archive, so you can get to any entry in the zip archive
without having to skipping through all the preceeding entries.


= Version 0.1.0 =

First working version of ZipInputStream.
